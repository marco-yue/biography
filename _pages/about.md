## About Me

<p><font size=3>I received my B.S. degree (2016) in Logistics engineering and Operation research from University of Science and Technology Beijing, and my Master degree (2020) in Industrial engineering and Operation research from Beihang University.</font></p>


<p><font size=3>Now I am a PHD student, majored in Transportation Engineering of University of Sydney (USYD) and a member of <a href="https://transportlab.sydney.edu.au/">TransportLab</a> of USYD, and under the supervision by Professor Mohsen Ramezani to do some transportation researches focus on Stochastic Optimization, Reinforcement Learning and Games Theory.</font></p>


## Research Interests

<p><font size=3>
1. Intelligent transportation system (Ride-sourcing & Ride-hailing & Ridesharing systems like Uber and Didi chuxing)
  </font></p>

<p><font size=3>
2. Dynamic optimization and Stochastic optimization (Order dispatching & Ride matching & Repositioning & Fleet management)
   </font></p>

<p><font size=3>
3. Machine learning in transportation (Markov Decision Process & Multi-agent reinforcement learning)
   </font></p>
   
<p><font size=3>
4. Spatio-temporal Data-mining (Trajectory mining)
  </font></p>

## Hobbies

### League of Legends

I am good at Jungle, Support , AD carry and AP carry, I have four representative picks:

[Heimerdinger, the Revered Inventor](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/champions/heimerdinger/)

[Miss Fortune, the Bounty Hunter](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/champions/miss-fortune/)

[Jarvan IV, the Exemplar of Demacia](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/champions/jarvan-iv/)

### Music

My favorite music singer is BOL4 main vocals Ahn Ji-young, looking like an angel when she is singing.

### Football

My favorite football star is Marco Reus,  a German professional footballer and the captain of  Borussia Dortmund. I got to know him when I was thirteen and I was impressed by his talents, skills and handsome looking. In the following years, I was deeply motivated to be a good man like him.
