## About Me

<p><font size=3>I received my B.S. degree (2016) in Logistics engineering and Operation research from the University of Science and Technology Beijing and my Master's degree (2020) in Industrial engineering and Operation research from Beihang University.</font></p>


<p><font size=3>Now I am a PhD student, majoring in Transportation Engineering at the University of Sydney (USYD) and a member of <a href="https://transportlab.sydney.edu.au/home/research/control/">TransportLab</a> under the supervision of Mohsen Ramezani.  I focus on transportation research topics like Shared Mobility, Operation Strategy of Ride-sourcing markets and Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning in Transportation.</font></p>


## Research Interests

<p><font size=3>
1. Intelligent transportation system (Ride-sourcing & Ride-hailing & Ridesharing systems like Uber and Didi chuxing)
  </font></p>

<p><font size=3>
2. Dynamic optimization and Stochastic optimization (Order dispatching & Ride matching & Repositioning & Fleet management)
   </font></p>

<p><font size=3>
3. Machine learning in transportation (Markov Decision Process & Multi-agent reinforcement learning)
   </font></p>
   
<p><font size=3>
4. Spatio-temporal Data-mining (Trajectory mining)
  </font></p>
